GETTING STARTED
---------------

Download JMeter from http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/ and unpack. All file
locations are relative to the toplevel dir after unpacking (something like
jakarta-jmeter-2.0.2)

If you are running JMeter under IBM's JDK, edit bin/jmeter and comment out
all the variables that set -XX command line options. If you use Sun,
everything should work out of the box.


NOTE ON HTTPS
-------------

I haven't been able to make JMeter request HTTPS pages with the IBM JDK,
only the Sun JDK. If you try to run with the IBM JDK, you will get a
NoClassDefFoundError when JMeter tries to access an HTTPS URL; it's
missing com.cun.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier.

According to the docs, it should be possible to edit jmeter.properties
and change the ssl.provider and ssl.pkgs properties, but I haven't been
able to figure out what they should be set to. It might be possible to
make this work by adding Sun's jsse.jar, but I didn't try that.

Everything works fine with IBM's JDK as long as you stay away from HTTPS
requests. It's therefore best to disable HTTPS in the satellite by
setting web.ssl_available = 0 in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf

Note that the bug http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=28677
affects the HTML Link Parser processor, making working with links
extremely awkward when you request HTTPS pages.

The upshot of all this is: run your satellite under HTTP for
performance/stress testing
